#### Abstract

  - Adapting NASA Astrobee Robot Software for object detection and collision avoidance
  - 
  
  #### Introduction
* NASA intends to send these Astrobee Robots to the ISS for research assistance
* Astrobee Robot Software is a simulation of the ISS and the Astrobee Robot
* Allows Scientists to simulate experiments and commands on Earth before sending them to be executed by the actual Astrobee on the ISS
* 

#### Subjects, Methods, and Analysis
* NASA has the Astrobee Robot Software listed on Github
* The software uses ROS in order to operate the simulation and handle the image collection
* Using genetic algorithms we can provide ros commands to move the simulated astrobee to the desired coordinate location
* 
#### Research and Purpose
https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160007769.pdf
* Astrobees used for three scenarios: research, camera, and search
* Allows for autonomous research, monitoring, and location of tools on the ISS

* Genetic algorithms can be used to teach a robots its paths to take for its destination
* good for unsupervised learning
